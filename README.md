## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the app.


The development server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.<br>

## Features

My Awesome GitHub User Search App comes with several features, including:

- **User Search:** You can search for any GitHub user by typing their username in the search box.

- **Custom Background Color:** The app allows you to set a custom background color for each alphabet. For example:
  - Usernames starting with 'A' will have a red background.<br><br>
  ![Usernames starting with 'A'](https://github.com/hady68/find-github-users/assets/64458111/c5e61d5d-9e2b-417d-aedc-e58e5ed45340) <br><br>

  - Usernames starting with 'B' will have a black background.<br><br>
  ![Usernames starting with 'B'](https://github.com/hady68/find-github-users/assets/64458111/47939ffd-d1b9-4b94-8525-3ef0159b584d) <br><br>

  - Usernames starting with 'C' will have a green background.<br><br>
  ![Usernames starting with 'C'](https://github.com/hady68/find-github-users/assets/64458111/fb0a6276-cd93-4f58-af4b-269163a46699)<br><br>

  - And so on, for all letters from A to Z.

Feel free to explore and use these features to search for GitHub users and customize background colors based on usernames.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following npm scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Run this script to run your app's tests. For more information, refer to the [running tests documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is now ready for deployment. Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you ever need to customize the build tool and configuration, you can use the `eject` command. It will copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. You'll have full control over them, but you won't be able to undo this operation. While you don't have to use `eject`, it provides more flexibility for advanced configurations.
